This course presents a general framework for causal inference. Directed acyclic graphs and non-parametric structural equation models are used to define the causal model. Causal parameters are defined using counterfactuals and interventional models. By the end of this course, students will be able to develop familiarity with causal models for investigating a wide range of questions about the world works. 

### Goals:
- Scientific literacy: learning to be informed citizens, consumers, and hopefully producers. 
- Understand bias sources in data (a big challenge in data science). 
- Understand importance of causal discovery. 
- Understand basics of causal models. 
- Pose causal questions: 
    - Science (is this drug good? Is this solution effective?), 
    - Better decision making. 
- Get you thinking about what statistics and machine learning really are.  


### Learning Objectives:
1. Understand the difference of causal inference with statistics and machine learning. 
2. Translate a scientific question and background knowledge into a causal model. 
3. Understand the properties of causal models. 
4. Begin to develop familiarity with the uses of causal models for investigating a wide range of questions about the real world.
