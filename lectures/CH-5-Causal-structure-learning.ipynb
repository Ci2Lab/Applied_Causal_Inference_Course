    "## How can we discover a causal structure from a dataset without domain knowledge?\n",
    "\n",
    "Causal structure identification or discovery can be challenging, especially when you have no prior knowledge or domain expertise about the dataset. In addition, it is an ongoing field of research, and there are limitations and challenges involved in inferring causal relationships from observational data alone. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, some methods and approaches can be employed to uncover causal relationships in such situations. Such methods can be divided into different categories. However, the two main groups are **Independence-Based Methods** and **Score-Based Methods**. We will explain them in more detail as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## A. Independence-Based Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Independence-based methods assume that the distribution is faithful to the underlying causal DAG. \n",
    "\n",
    "- In orher workds, there is a one-to-one correspondence between d-separationsin the graph and conditional independences in the distribution of the data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Any query of a d-separation statement can therefore be answered by checking the corresponding conditional independence test. \n",
    "\n",
    "Independence-based methods test for conditional independences in the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "- These properties are related to the graph structure by the Markov condition and faithfulness.\n",
    "- However,often the graph is not uniquely identifiable; the method may therefore output different graphs for the same dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below summarizes the independence-based approaches for the identification of causal structures. \n",
    "\n",
    "![img](img/ch6/independence_tests.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Most independence-based methods first estimate the skeleton, the undirected edges, and then orient as many edges as possible afterward.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Estimation of the skeleton\n",
    "\n",
    "- knowing which variables are connected by an arrow but not what direction the arrows point.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Two nodes $X,Y$ in a DAG $(\\mathbf{X},\\mathcal{E})$ are adjacent if and only if they cannot be d-separated by any subset $S \\in \\mathbf{V} \\ {X,Y}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If two nodes $X,Y$ in a DAG $(\\mathbf{X},\\mathcal{E})$ are not adjacent, then they are d-separated by either $\\mathbf{Pa}_X$ or $\\mathbf{Pa}_Y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It follows that if two variables are always dependent, no matter what other variables one conditions on, these two variables must be adjacent (i.e., an edge must connect them).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Orientation of Edges\n",
    "\n",
    "- After the skeleton is built, if two nodes are not directly connected in the obtained skeleton, there is a set that d-separates these nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Often, we’ll only be able to orient some arrows. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The ambiguity of the directions of other arrows generates a class of causal structures, e.g. a markov equavalnt class.\n",

    "## B. Score-based Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Independent-based causal discovery methods rely on conditional independence tests, which assume faithfulness between the DAG and the data. However, this assumption is quite strong, and obtaining reliable conditional independence tests may require large sample sizes. Additionally, the outcome of Independent-based causal discovery methods is often non-unique, meaning that multiple graph structures can fit the data equally well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, Score-based methods for causal discovery are approaches that aim to identify causal relationships by evaluating the fit or goodness-of-fit of different causal models to the observed data. \n",
    "\n",
    "These score-based methods assign scores to different causal structures based on how well they explain the data, and the structure with the highest score is considered the most likely causal model. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Score-based Methods for causal discovery have two main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   a) **Search Algorithm** to optimize throughout the search space of all possible DAGs (e.g. *Hill Climb Search, Exhaustive Search, and Chow-Liu*)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*   b) **Scoring Function** to measure how well a Bayesian network fits the data. Commonly used scoring functions are *K2* and the *Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a dataset $\\mathcal{D} = (X^1,\\dots,X^n)$ from a vector $X$ of variables (e.g., a sample containing $n$ i.i.d. observations), the idea is to assign a score $S(\\mathcal{D}, \\mathcal{G})$ to each graph $\\mathcal{G}$ and search over the space of DAGs to find the graph with the highest score:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{ \\mathcal{G} } = argmax_\\mathcal{ \\{G\\} } S(\\mathcal{D},\\mathcal{G})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### a) Search Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "A search algorithm is used to explore the graph space (i.e., the set of all possible graphs given the nodes) to maximize (or minimize) the given score function. \n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of search method depends on various factors, including the size of the variable set, computational resources, and specific requirements of the causal discovery task. Different search methods have their strengths and limitations in terms of computational efficiency, accuracy, and ability to handle large-scale problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following are some examples of search methods used in causal discovery. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exhaustive Search:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Exhaustive search is a straightforward but computationally intensive method that evaluates all possible causal structures within a given set of variables. \n",
    "- It systematically examines every combination of directed edges and evaluates their fit using the scoring criterion. \n",
    "- However, exhaustive search becomes infeasible for large variable sets due to the exponential growth of possible structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Greedy Search Techniques:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Greedy search methods iteratively build causal structures by adding or removing edges based on their impact on the score.\n",
    "- They start with an initial structure, such as an empty graph, and iteratively modify it to improve the score. \n",
    "- The search terminates once a local maximum is found, i.e. adding other edges would not increase the score associated to the model.\n",
    "- Popular greedy search algorithms include the Hill-Climbing algorithm and its variants. \n",
    "- Greedy searches reach to a local optimum and cannot guarantee an optimal solution. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Metaheuristic Search:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Metaheuristic search methods, such as genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, or simulated annealing, employ stochastic optimization techniques to explore the space of possible causal structures. \n",
    "- These methods use iterative processes that involve randomly perturbing or modifying existing structures and selecting or refining the best-fitting structures based on the scoring criterion.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### b) Scoring Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Scoring functions $S$, also known as scoring criteria or scoring metrics, are used in score-based causal discovery approaches to evaluate and compare the fit of different causal structures to the observed data, with higher scores indicating better fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some commonly used scoring functions in score-based causal discovery:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC):** \n",
    "\n",
    "- The BIC scoring function is based on the principle of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) and takes into account both the likelihood of the data and the number of parameters in the model.\n",
    "- BIC penalizes more complex models to avoid overfitting and favors simpler models that still provide a good fit to the data.\n",
    "- the BIC scoring function is often used in combination with search algorithms, such as hill climbing or genetic algorithms, to explore and evaluate different causal structures. \n",
    "- BIC for data $\\mathcal{D}$ and graph $\\mathcal{G}$ defines as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$BIC(\\mathcal{D},\\mathcal{G}) = -2 * log(L) + k * log(n)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $L$ is the likelihood of the data given the causal model, $k$ is the number of parameters in the model, and $n$ is the sample size. The first term ($-2 * log(L)$) represents the fit of the model to the data, with lower values indicating a better fit. The second term ($k * log(n)$) penalizes the model complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Akaike Information Criterion (AIC):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Like the BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion), the AIC is a measure that balances the goodness-of-fit of a model to the data with the complexity of the model.\n",
    "- The AIC scoring function is derived from information theory and is based on the principle of maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). \n",
    "- It evaluates the fit of a model by considering both the likelihood of the data and the number of parameters in the model. \n",
    "- AIC for data $\\mathcal{D}$ and graph $\\mathcal{G}$ defines as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$AIC(\\mathcal{D},\\mathcal{G}) = -2 * log(L) + 2 *k$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $L$ is the likelihood of the data given the causal model, and $k$ is the number of parameters in the model. In the AIC score, the first term ($-2 * log(L)$) represents the fit of the model to the data, with lower values indicating a better fit. The second term ($2 * k$) penalizes the model complexity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike the BIC, which includes a penalty factor that increases with the sample size, the AIC penalty term is a fixed factor of 2 multiplied by the number of parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bayesian Scoring Criterion (BS):** \n",
    "\n",
    "- The Bayesian score function, also known as the Bayesian scoring criterion or the Bayesian information score, incorporates Bayesian principles and probabilities to evaluate the fit of different causal structures to the observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Bayesian score function considers both the likelihood of the data given the causal model and the prior probability of the model itself. \n",
    "\n",
    "- It assigns scores to different causal structures based on their posterior probabilities, which are obtained by combining the prior probabilities and the likelihoods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The structure with the highest Bayesian score is considered the most plausible model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Bayesian score function can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$BS(\\mathcal{D},\\mathcal{G}) = log P(\\mathcal{D} , \\mathcal{G}) = log (P(\\mathcal{D} | \\mathcal{G}) * P(\\mathcal{G})) = log P(\\mathcal{D} | \\mathcal{G}) + log P(\\mathcal{G})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $log P(\\mathcal{D} | \\mathcal{G})$ represents the likelihood of the observed data given the causal model, and $P(\\mathcal{G})$ represents the prior probability of the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **likelihood term** $log P(\\mathcal{D} | \\mathcal{G})$ assesses how well the model explains the observed data. It evaluates the fit of the model by considering the probability distribution implied by the model and comparing it to the actual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **prior probability term** $P(\\mathcal{G})$ represents prior knowledge or assumptions about the probability of each causal structure. It encodes beliefs or expectations about the plausibility of different structures before observing the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to note that the Bayesian score function requires prior probabilities, which can be based on expert knowledge or can be specified using non-informative priors. The choice of prior probabilities may influence the results, and different choices can lead to different model selections.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### c) Other Causal Discovery Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Causal discovery methods can be categorized into several different approaches based on the underlying principles and techniques they employ. We explaned two major approaches, **Independence-Based Methods** and **Score-Based Methods**.\n",
