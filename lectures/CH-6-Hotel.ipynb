    "Since the number of number of cancellations and the number of times a different room was assigned is heavily imbalanced, we first choose 1000 observations at random to see that in how many cases do the variables; '*is_cancelled*' & '*different_room_assigned*' attain the same values. This whole process is then repeated 10000 times and the expected count turns out to be 51.8% which is almost 50% (i.e. the probability of these two variables attaining the same value at random). So statistically speaking, we have no definite conclusion at this stage. Thus assigning rooms different to what a customer had reserved during his booking earlier, may or may not lead to him/her cancelling that booking."
