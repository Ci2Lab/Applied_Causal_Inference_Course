# Applied Causal Inference Course

![img](lectures/img/causality_intro_image.png)

This course offers a comprehensive overview of applied causal inference, focusing on developing a deep understanding of how to analyze and model cause-and-effect relationships in various domains.

The course begins with an introduction to the foundations of causal inference, including core concepts like correlation, association, and the limitations of traditional statistical methods. It then progresses to more advanced topics, such as interventions, counterfactuals, and graphical causal models like Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and Structural Causal Models (SCMs). Practical examples, real-world case studies, and hands-on activities are used throughout the course to solidify learning.

By the end of the course, students will be able to build, interpret, and analyze causal models to address a wide range of scientific and real-world problems using modern data science techniques.

This is an ongoing course, so keep track of updates and feel free to share your feedback.

### Course Goals:
- Build data literacy to critically engage with information and data in the modern world.
- Develop an understanding of bias in data, particularly in the context of causal discovery.
- Learn and apply the principles of causal modeling using DAGs and SCMs to infer cause-and-effect relationships.
- Gain practical experience in using causal inference techniques to analyze real-world data.

### Learning Objectives:
1. Translate scientific and practical questions into formal causal models.
2. Understand the theoretical properties and assumptions underlying causal models.
3. Apply causal models and methods to investigate questions across a variety of domains, from economics and healthcare to machine learning and AI.
